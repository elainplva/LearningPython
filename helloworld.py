#Linting highlights semantic and stylistic problems in your
# Python source code, which often helps you identify and correct 
# subtle programming errors or coding practices that can lead to errors. 
# For example, linting can detect the use of an undefined variable, calls 
# to undefined functions, missing parentheses, and even more subtle issues
#  such as attempting to redefine built-in types or functions.
